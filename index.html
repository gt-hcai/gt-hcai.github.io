The objective of this working group is to study and bring together research activities in France focused on designing and analyzing AI from a human-centered perspective. Human-centered AI is an emerging discipline that focuses on:

- understanding and creating AI systems that place the benefit of humans and human society at the forefront, and

- understanding the current and future impact of AI technologies on human activities and capabilities.

This involves not only understanding and designing how AI systems interact with individual users and groups, but also developing systems that are more explainable, controllable, accountable, and trustworthy.

This working group addresses the priority theme “HCI and society,” through the lenses of “individual and collective sovereignty” and “ethical use of technologies,” as well as the theme “Technology serving humanity,” through the axis of “holistic study of interaction.”
