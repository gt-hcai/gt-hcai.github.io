**25 November 2025 – Hybrid Event (Paris & Online)** <br>
*Organized by the HCAI Working Group of the GDR IHM.*


We are pleased to announce a one-day workshop dedicated to exploring current research in Human-Centred AI (HCAI) in France. This event brings together researchers, practitioners, and students interested in designing and understanding AI systems that place humans at the center.



The program features: **keynote talks** by Wendy Mackay and Jules Françoise, **research presentations** covering diverse aspects of HCAI and **live demonstrations** of emerging technologies and systems. 

The workshop aims to generate three outcomes: a  map of current HCAI research in France that highlights active themes; a list of funding opportunities through which new HCAI projects can be developed; and a set of concrete actions that the working group will pursue to structure future activities in this research area.


### Attendance

This workshop will be held in **hybrid format**, welcoming participants both:

- **In person** at the Institute for Institute for Intelligent Systems and Robotics (ISIR), Sorbonne Université, Paris ([see access map below](#access))
- **Online via Zoom**, for those unable to travel ([Zoom link](https://cnrs.zoom.us/j/91521880919?pwd=ZWGTVV3CrRCWakwqBKs9gvGbN0Pqq5.1))
