We organized a half-day workshop, which took place on July 3, 2025 from 1:30 to 3:30 pm, as part of the inaugural day of the GDR IHM. The purpose of this half-day event was to discuss together the expectations of the working group on this theme, and how we should structure this working group to best support our community. 

This half-day event was held face-to-face in Lyon, and online. The event was held in English. If you wish to attend in person, you must register for the GDR IHM inaugural day before Friday 20 June 2025. To prepare for this event, we prepared a quick survey (5min) that we invited participants to complete. This survey enabled us to find out whether you will attend the half-day event and, even if you don’t, to gather information for the GT.
